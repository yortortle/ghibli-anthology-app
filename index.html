        <p>Director Importance: <p> The reason sorting by director is important is because of the massive influence that Hayao Miyazaki actually had on these films. Some diehard viewers of the Ghibli films mainly consider the ones directed by the elder Miyazaki to be important, and others to be tertiary. This isn't to say the others aren't good, films such as Porco Rosso and Return of The Cat are great films, but the cultural impact they've had is minimal compared to films such as Princess Mononoke and Spirited away.</p>
